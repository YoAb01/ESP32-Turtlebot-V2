# üìÅ G - Camera


### **Introduction**
---
Cameras are critical for giving robots vision-based perception, enabling tasks such as object recognition, line and color detection, visual slam and navigation and much more. They provide rich contextual information compared to distance or binary sensors like IR or ultrasonic. However, they require more processing power and efficient data handling to extract meaningful insights from images or video streams.

In our application, our ESP32-S3 is equipped with a camera module named OV3660. It is a CMOS image sensor type that provide output up to 2 megapixels.
